## Our Implementation Proccess for Phase 3
We have created a new lru cache class and
By using that class we are able to divide the address into tags ,number of bits and index.
By using access boolean we are able to know that the address is already in the cache or not.
By knowing the above information we are able to calculate hit_rate and miss_rate.
